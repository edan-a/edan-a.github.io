    <h1>The barrier of language</h1>
    <p>Language is needed for any kind of communication, even people with speech impairments communicate with sign language and brail. </p>
    <p>Language is one of the most basic element for human and their society.</p> 
    <p>Now, no society doesn't have language to communication on the world.</p>
    <p>The language is not only used by human, but other animals that are dolphin, whale or other primates.</p>
    <p>Especially, human's language is the most complex and varuable one on the earth.<p/>
    <p>Communication becomes difficult in situations where people don’t understand each others’ language.</p>
    <p>It is said that there are more than 7,000 human languages currently used on Earth.</p>
    <p>The inability to communicate using a language is known as language barrier to communication.</p>
    <p>The difference of language offen caused problems or struggle between people.</p>
    <p>Privious, the human couldn't speak the language that is common one of the area, they were not treated not human but monster.</p>
    <p>It is said that the legend of Goblin or Orga came from trives have other language.</p>
    <p>Most of the people in the world do not speak English or, even if they use, it is their second or third language. </p>
    <p>If the speaker and receiver do not use same language and words, there is no meaning to the communication. </p>
    <p>Not using the words that other person understands makes the communication ineffective and prevents message from being conveyed.</p>

      <h2>How can you break the barrier of language?</h2>
      <p>Now, the barrier of language i thiner than privious era.</p>
      <p>It is development the research of language and trandlater.</p>
      <p>Google translater is one of the mmost popular one.</p>
      <p>However, you have to study other language if you want to communicate other countries' people</p>
      <p>Because the function of translater is incomplete one for humanely‐oriented communication.</p>
      <p>Languages mirror the culture of this place, and it has deeply relationships between each history or common sense.</p>
      <p>The sutdy of language is hard study.</p>
      <p>It is need try and error, remember to mistake, remember with gesture or speaking and writing spree etc.</p>
