       <p>I'm experiencing the high and thick of the barrier of language.</p>
       <p>English is different and strange language for me, and I cannot be used to speak or write English still now.</p>
      <p>I feel some of the frastration or anxiety for discomunication between other people.</p>
      <p>I think the reason why the change of language causes the stress, and it is such as change the environmental.</p>
      <p>Language is one of the most basic system for human's society, and it is the same thing as atomospher for human.</p>
